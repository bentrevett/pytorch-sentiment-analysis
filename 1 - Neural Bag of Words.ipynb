    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first notebook, we'll start very simple with one of the most basic models for _NLP_ (natural language processing): a _NBoW_ (_neural bag-of-words_) model (also known as _continuous bag-of-words_, _CBoW_). The NBoW model are a strong, commonly used, baseline model for NLP tasks. They should be one of the first models you implement when performing sentiment analysis/text classification.\n",

    "\n",
    "An NBoW model takes in a sequence of $T$ _tokens_, $X=\\{x_1,...,x_T\\} \\in \\mathbb{Z}^T$ and passes each token through an _embedding layer_ to obtain a sequence of _embedding vectors_. The sequence of embedding vectors is just known as an _embedding_, $E=\\{e_1,...,e_T\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times D}$, where $D$ is known as the _embedding dimension_. It then _pools_ the embeddings across the sequence dimension to get $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ and then finally passes $P$ through a linear layer (also known as a fully connected layer), to get a prediction, $\\hat{Y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^C$, where $C$ is the number of classes. We'll explain what a token is, and what each of the layers -- embedding layer, pooling, and linear layer -- do in due course.\n",

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.',\n",

    "### Creating a Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have to build a _vocabulary_. This is look-up table where every unique token in your dataset has a corresponding _index_ (an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this as machine learning models cannot operate on strings, only numerical vaslues. Each _index_ is used to construct a _one-hot_ vector for each token. A one-hot vector is a vector where all the elements are 0, except one, which is 1, and the dimensionality is the total number of unique tokens in your vocabulary, commonly denoted by $V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/vocabulary.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with creating a vocabulary using every single word in the dataset is that there are usually a considerable amount of unique tokens. One way to combat this is to either only construct the vocabulary only using the most commonly appearing tokens, or to only use tokens which appear a minimum amount of times in the dataset. In this notebook, we do the latter, keeping on the tokens which appear 5 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens to tokens which appear less than 5 times? We replace them with a special _unknown_ token, denoted by `<unk>`. For example, if the sentence \"This film is great and I love it\", but the word \"love\" was not in the vocabulary, it would become: \"This film is great and I \\<unk\\> it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `build_vocab_from_iterator` function from `torchtext.vocab` to create our vocabulary, specifying the `min_freq` (the minimum amount of times a token should appear to be added to the vocabulary) and `special_tokens` (tokens which should be appended to the start of the vocabulary, even if they don't appear `min_freq` times in the dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first special token is our unknown token, the other, `<pad>` is a special token we'll use for padding sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we feed sentences into our model, we pass a _batch_ of sentences, i.e. more than one, at the same time. Passing a batch of sentences is preferred to passing sentences one at a time as it allows our model to perform computation on all sentences within a batch in paralle, thus speeding up the time taken to train and evaluate our model. All sentences within a batch need to be the same length (in terms of the number of tokens). Thus, to ensure each sentence is the same length, any shorter than the longest sentence need to have padding tokens appended to the end of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an example batch of two sentences of length four and three tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/padding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the second sentence has been padded with a single `<pad>` token.\n"
