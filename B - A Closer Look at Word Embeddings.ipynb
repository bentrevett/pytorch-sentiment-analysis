    "# B - A Closer Look at Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "We have very briefly covered how word embeddings (also known as word vectors) are used in the tutorials. In this appendix we'll have a closer look at these embeddings and find some (hopefully) interesting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings transform a one-hot encoded vector (a vector that is 0 in elements except one, which is 1) into a much smaller dimension vector of real numbers. The one-hot encoded vector is also known as a *sparse vector*, whilst the real valued vector is known as a *dense vector*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key concept in these word embeddings is that words that appear in similar _contexts_ appear nearby in the vector space, i.e. the Euclidean distance between these two word vectors is small. By context here, we mean the surrounding words. For example in the sentences \"I purchased some items at the shop\" and \"I purchased some items at the store\" the words 'shop' and 'store' appear in the same context and thus should be close together in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have also heard about *word2vec*. *word2vec* is an algorithm (actually a bunch of algorithms) that calculates word vectors from a corpus. In this appendix we use *GloVe* vectors, *GloVe* being another algorithm to calculate word vectors. If you want to know how *word2vec* works, check out a two part series [here](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) and [here](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/), and if you want to find out more about *GloVe*, check the website [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, we use word vectors with the `nn.Embedding` layer, which takes a _**[sentence length, batch size]**_ tensor and transforms it into a _**[sentence length, batch size, embedding dimensions]**_ tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tutorial 2 onwards, we also used pre-trained word embeddings (specifically the GloVe vectors) provided by TorchText. These embeddings have been trained on a gigantic corpus. We can use these pre-trained vectors within any of our models, with the idea that as they have already learned the context of each word they will give us a better starting point for our word vectors. This usually leads to faster training time and/or improved accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this appendix we won't be training any models, instead we'll be looking at the word embeddings and finding a few interesting things about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of the code from the first half of this appendix is taken from [here](https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/glove-word-vectors/glove-word-vectors.ipynb). For more information about word embeddings, go [here](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/word-embeddings-transform-text-numbers/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading the GloVe vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll load the GloVe vectors. The `name` field specifies what the vectors have been trained on, here the `6B` means a corpus of 6 billion words. The `dim` argument specifies the dimensionality of the word vectors. GloVe vectors are available in 50, 100, 200 and 300 dimensions. There is also a `42B` and `840B` glove vectors, however they are only available at 300 dimensions."
