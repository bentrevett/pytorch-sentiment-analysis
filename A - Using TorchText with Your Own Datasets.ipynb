    "What do we mean when we say \"becomes the batch object's attribute name\"? Recall in the previous exercises where we accessed the `TEXT` and `LABEL` fields in the train/evaluation loop by using `batch.text` and `batch.label`, this is because TorchText sets the batch object to have a `text` and `label` attribute, each being a tensor containing either the text or the label.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Also, if the values of `json` field are a string then the `Fields` tokenization is applied (default is to split the string on spaces), however if the values are a list then no tokenization is applied. Usually it is a good idea for the data to already be tokenized into a list, this saves time as you don't have to wait for TorchText to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The value of the `json` fields do not have to be the same type. Some examples can have their `\"quote\"` as a string, and some as a list. The tokenization will only get applied to the ones with their `\"quote\"` as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are using a `json` field, every single example must have an instance of that field, e.g. in this example all examples must have a name, location and quote. However, as we are not using the age field, it does not matter if an example does not have it."

This means data cannot be already be tokenized, thus everytime you run your Python script that reads this data via TorchText, it has to be tokenized. Using advanced tokenizers, such as the `spaCy` tokenizer, takes a non-negligible amount of time. Thus, it is better to tokenize your datasets and store them in the `json lines` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If tabs appear in your `tsv` data, or commas appear in your `csv` data, TorchText will think they are delimiters between columns. This will cause your data to be parsed incorrectly. Worst of all TorchText will not alert you to this as it cannot tell the difference between a tab/comma in a field and a tab/comma as a delimiter. As `json` data is essentially a dictionary, you access the data within the fields via its key, so do not have to worry about \"surprise\" delimiters."
